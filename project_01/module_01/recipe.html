    <img src="https://preppykitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Peanut-Butter-Cookies-Blog-1.jpg" alt="Peanut Butter Cookies">
    <p>You'll love these ULTRA-easy peanut butter cookies. They're full of peanut butter flavor and have the perfect balance of salty and sweet with a wonderfully soft, melt in your mouth texture. This cookie is a classic for a reason!

    </p>
    <p>Adding peanut butter to cookies creates an amazing soft consistency with a very delicate, velvety crumb. These classic peanut butter cookies are complete crowd pleasers.

    </p>
    <p>You can make them days in advance for instant gratification anytime and they’re so easy to make! The most difficult part is having the patience to let them set up after they’re out of the oven. For another cookie recipe that utilizes peanut butter, try my Easy No Bake Cookies!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 Cups of All-Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp of Vanilla Extract</li>
        <li>1 Egg</li>
        <li>1 Cup Peanut Butter</li>
        <li>1/2 Cup Butter</li>
        <li>1/2 Cup of Sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 Cup of Brown Sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp Baking Powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
<li>Preheat over to 350F. Sift flour and baking powder together into a large bowl then whisk to combine.</li>
<li>Cream butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar in a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Add peanut butter and mix until incorporated.

</li>
<li>Mix in the room temperature egg and vanilla extract then scrape the bowl down and mix once more.</li>
<li>Add flour mixture and beat on low until just incorporated.</li>
<li>Roll the cookie dough into one inch balls and place on baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
<li>Flatten the cookie dough balls with a fork in a criss-cross pattern. Bake cookies for about 8 minutes. Allow cookies to cool completely on baking sheet, they need to set up before being transferred.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You will bake the cookies until almost done when the edge is just starting to change color. They will set up and continue baking with the residual internal heat after they’re pulled out of the oven.
        </li>
        <li>Measure your flour correctly! Adding too much flour to the recipe is the most common mistake. The best, and easiest way to measure flour is by using a scale. If you don’t have one then fluff your flour with a spoon, sprinkle it into your measuring cup, and use a knife to level it off. If you have any questions about flour measuring check out the YouTube video I made about it.
        </li>
        <li>The cookies will be VERY soft just out of the oven so let them rest for a while on the baking sheets before transferring to a wire rack; when cooled they will be firm enough to handle and quite delicious.  
        </li>
        <li>Store in an airtight container for up to a week for delicious anytime treats.
        </li>
    </ul>
